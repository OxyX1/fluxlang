mod <stdio.fp> // this imports .fp packages. there is no stdio.fp currently. But the only reason you would need this is for something like user32. You know, input, output, macros, etc..

int main() {
    output ++ "hello, world!"; // you do '++' to add text but rather not set the output to "hello, world!".
    return 0;
}

// the fluxc terminal will find the "_start" command automatically which is main().
